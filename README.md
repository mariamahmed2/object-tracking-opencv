# Real-time Object Detection System

The project involved building a real-time object detection system using OpenCV, Python, and other related libraries.

## Description

The system is capable of detecting objects in a live video stream from either a webcam or an IP camera, making use of various image processing techniques such as thresholding, erosion, dilation, and morphological operations. It also includes features such as adjustable sliders for thresholding and kernel size, as well as the ability to draw contours around the detected objects.

To make the system more practical, it can also calculate the distance between two points in the detected object using the perspective transformation technique.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to install Python and the required libraries, including OpenCV, NumPy, and imutils. Once you have the necessary dependencies installed, you can run the project by running the `distance.py` file.
