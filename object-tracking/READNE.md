# Real-time Object Detection System

As a passionate computer vision enthusiast, I embarked on a personal project to explore and learn more about various image processing techniques. The project involved building a real-time object detection system using OpenCV, Python, and other related libraries.

## Description

The system is capable of detecting objects in a live video stream from either a webcam or an IP camera, making use of various image processing techniques such as thresholding, erosion, dilation, and morphological operations. It also includes features such as adjustable sliders for thresholding and kernel size, as well as the ability to draw contours around the detected objects.

To make the system more practical, it can also calculate the distance between two points in the detected object using the perspective transformation technique, which is particularly useful for applications such as measuring the distance between two points in an image.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to install Python and the required libraries, including OpenCV, NumPy, and imutils. Once you have the necessary dependencies installed, you can run the project by running the `real_time_object_detection.py` file.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using a webcam or IP camera
- Adjustable sliders for thresholding and kernel size
- Ability to draw contours around the detected objects
- Calculation of the distance between two points in the detected object using the perspective transformation technique

## Conclusion

Overall, this project has been an exciting and challenging learning experience, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of computer vision and image processing techniques. It has also given me the opportunity to develop my Python coding skills and improve my ability to work with libraries such as OpenCV.
